# PA1: Scheduling-Algorithms

Assignment:

	Implement the First-Come First-Served, preemptive Shortest Job First, and Round-Robin algorithms 
	as for single processors.

Input:

	Program will read a file from the current directory called "processes.in",
	which will be formatted as shown below.
	The program should ignore everything on a line after a # mark and ignore additional spaces in input.

Sample Input:

	processcount 2        # Read 5 processes
	runfor 15             # Run for 15 time units
	use rr                # Can be fcfs, sjf, or rr
	quantum 2             # Time quantum â€“ only if using rr
	process name P1 arrival 3 burst 5
	process name P2 arrival 0 burst 9
	end
Note that the processes do not need to be specified in order of arrival, and do not need to have similar names.

Output:

	Generate a file called "processes.out", formatted as shown below.

Sample Output:

	2 processes
	Using Round-Robin
	Quantum 2

	Time 0: P2 arrived
	Time 0: P2 selected (burst 9)
	Time 2: P2 selected (burst 7)
	Time 3: P1 arrived
	Time 4: P1 selected (burst 5)
	Time 6: P2 selected (burst 5)
	Time 8: P1 selected (burst 3)
	Time 10: P2 selected (burst 3)
	Time 12: P1 selected (burst 1)
	Time 13: P1 finished
	Time 13: P2 selected (burst 1)
	Time 14: P2 finished
	Time 14: Idle
	Finished at time 15

	P1 wait 5 turnaround 10
	P2 wait 5 turnaround 14

Clarifications:

	This version of Round-Robin should not run the scheduler immediately upon the arrival of a new process,
	unless the CPU is currently idle.

	The program will not be given an input that results in an ambiguous decision,
	such as identical arrival times for Round-Robin or identical burst lengths for SJF.
